# CHICKEN itself is written in CHICKEN. In order to bootstrap the compiler
# upstream provides release tarballs which include pre-compiled C files.
# However, occasionally we need to backport patches from upstream that
# modify the original Scheme (case in point CVE-2022-45145). In this
# case, we need to be able to compile CHICKEN from scratch without
# relying on the pre-compiled C files. For this reason, we package
# chicken-bootstrap (compiled from the pre-compiled C files) and chicken
# (which is potentially patched and is compiled from the Scheme sources).

	make PROGRAM_SUFFIX=-bootstrap PREFIX=/usr

	# chicken does not support parallel installs.
