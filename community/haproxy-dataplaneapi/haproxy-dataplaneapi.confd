CONFIGFILE=/etc/haproxy/dataplaneapi.yml

# dataplaneapi should be able to restart haproxy service, so by default it runs
# as root. However if your system is running haproxy with a process manager
# that doesn't require root privilege to be operated, then you should run it as
# a non-privileged user.
#command_user="haproxy:haproxy"

# Comment out to disable process supervisor.
