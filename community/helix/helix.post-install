* Tree-sitter grammars for syntax highlighting are packaged separately.
* There are currently two options for adding tree-sitter grammar support:
* 1) Install the helix-tree-sitter-vendor package: Installs tree-sitter support from the helix project, per their recommendation.
* 2) Install helix-tree-sitter-system, plus tree-sitter-<lang> packages for individual languages, or the tree-sitter-grammars meta package: This is **not** recommended by the helix project and may not function properly
