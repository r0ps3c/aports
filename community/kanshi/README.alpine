Running kanshi as an OpenRC user service
========================================

This package provides an OpenRC user service which can be started from
a custom GUI runlevel (after WAYLAND_DISPLAY has been set by the compositor).
Creation of this runlevel is documented in the Wiki:

	https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/OpenRC#User_services

Afterwards, enable the kanshi service by adding it to this runlevel:

	rc-update add --user kanshi gui
