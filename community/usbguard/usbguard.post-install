* WARNING:

* Prior to starting the USBGuard daemon (or service) for the first time
* we need to generate a rules file for USBGuard so that the currently attached
* USB devices (in particular mouse and keyboard) keep working
* so that you will not GET LOCKED OUT OF YOUR SYSTEM.
*
* A rules file can be generated like this:
*
*   $ doas sh -c 'usbguard generate-policy > /etc/usbguard/rules.conf'
