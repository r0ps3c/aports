Subject: [PATCH 2/4] Unpin NumPy build requirement

This is so high simply to take advantage of the new
backwards-compatibility guarantee in NumPy 1.25, but Fedora will never
run against a version different from the one it was built against.

-    #      and disabling build isolation.
-    #   3. The <2.3 upper bound is for matching the numpy deprecation policy,
-    #      it should not be loosened.
