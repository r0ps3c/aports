Recent linux kernels contain substantial changes to the way entropy is
handled.

I discussed the current situation of rngd and modern Linux kernels with the
rng-tools maintainer in https://github.com/nhorman/rng-tools/issues/195"

Based on his feedback it appears that rngd serves no practical purpose with
modern Linux kernels and running it is not recommended.
