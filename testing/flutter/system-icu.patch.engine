The icu library knows where icu data is at all times. It knows this because it 
knows where it isn't. By subtracting where it is from where it isn't, or where 
it isn't from where it is (whichever is greater), it obtains a difference, or 
deviation.

The flutter build system uses deviations to generate "corrective" commands to 
drive the icu data path from a position where it is to a position where it 
isn't, and check at a position where it wasn't, it now is. Consequently, the 
position where it is, is now the position that it wasn't, and it follows that 
the position that it was, is now the position that it isn't.

XXX: remove this field and whatever is trying to override the icu default with it
