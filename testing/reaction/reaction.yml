# Note for Alpine Linux users:
# This default configuration uses the program ip46tables.
# To install it, simply run:
#     apk add reaction-tools

# definitions are just a place to put chunks of conf you want to reuse in another place
# using YAML anchors `&name` and pointers `*name`
# definitions are not readed by reaction

# ip46tables is a minimal C program (only POSIX dependencies) present as a subdirectory.
# it permits to handle both ipv4/iptables and ipv6/ip6tables commands

# patterns are substitued in regexes.
# when a filter performs an action, it replaces the found pattern
patterns:
  ip:
    # reaction regex syntax is defined here: https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax

            # let's say reaction is quitting. does it run all those pending commands which had an `after` duration set?
            # if you want reaction to run those pending commands before exiting, you can set this:
            # onexit: true
            # (defaults to false)
            # here it is not useful because we will flush and delete the chain containing the bans anyway
            # (with the stop commands)

# persistence
# tldr; when an `after` action is set in a filter, such filter acts as a 'jail',
# which is persisted after reboots.
#
# when a filter is triggered, there are 2 flows:
#
# if none of its actions have an `after` directive set:
# no action will be replayed.
#
# else (if at least one action has an `after` directive set):
# if reaction stops while `after` actions are pending:
# and reaction starts again while those actions would still be pending:
# reaction executes the past actions (actions without after or with then+after < now)
# and plans the execution of future actions (actions with then+after > now)
