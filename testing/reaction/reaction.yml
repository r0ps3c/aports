# This default configuration uses the program ip46tables.
# To install it, simply run:

# This example configuration file is a good starting point, but you're
# strongly encouraged to take a look at the full documentation: https://reaction.ppom.me

# This file is using the well-established YAML configuration language.
# Note that the more powerful JSONnet configuration language is also supported
# and that the documentation uses JSONnet

# definitions are just a place to put chunks of conf you want to reuse in another place
# using YAML anchors `&name` and pointers `*name`
# definitions are not readed by reaction

# ip46tables is a minimal C program (only POSIX dependencies) present as a subdirectory.

# tldr; when an `after` action is set in a filter, such filter acts as a 'jail',

# when a filter is triggered, there are 2 flows:
#
# if none of its actions have an `after` directive set:
# no action will be replayed.
#
# else (if at least one action has an `after` directive set):
# if reaction stops while `after` actions are pending:
# and reaction starts again while those actions would still be pending:
# reaction executes the past actions (actions without after or with then+after < now)
# and plans the execution of future actions (actions with then+after > now)
