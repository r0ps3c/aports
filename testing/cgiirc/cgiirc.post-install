* CGI:IRC has been installed to:
*     /usr/share/webapps/cgiirc
* An config file has been installed to:
*     /etc/cgiirc/cgiirc.config
* If you use lighttpd:
*     1) Enable mod_cgi from lighttpd.conf and modify it adding in cgi.assign section:
* cgi.assign = (
*				".pl"	=>	"/usr/bin/perl",
*				".cgi"	=>	"/usr/bin/perl",
*
* )
*     2) Create a symlink to /usr/share/webapps/cgiirc:
*            ln -s /usr/share/webapps/cgiirc /var/www/localhost/htdocs/cgi-bin
*     This is needed because lighttpd mod_cgi matches cgi-bin dir in order to allow exec cgi.
*
*     3) Restart lighttpd when done.
*
*     4) Go with your browser in http://your.ip.address/cgi-bin/irc.cgi
